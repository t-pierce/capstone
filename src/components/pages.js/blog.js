        <h1>Map of the Soul: BTS Rise to International Fame</h1>

        <h2> Bangtan Boys! Louder than Bombs! If you haven't heard of BTS then I might assume you've been living under a rock or 
          you've chosen to live off the grid. But for those who don't know, BTS, an acroynm for Bangtan Sonyeondan, is a South Korean boy band 
          that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Hybe label, formely known as Big Hit Entertainment. The seven member group consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, 
          RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook; whom co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. With 5 korean-language studio albums and 4 japanese language studio albums, 
          BTS is gradually becoming a household worldwide. 

          A little backstory about me. I started listening to Kpop in high school in 2010. So I guess you can say, I'm a Kpop connoisseur. And it only took one song from BTS to have me hooked.
          With the release "Just One Day" from their "Skool Luv Affair" compilation album; I became a fan for life. But there's one album that get my attention everyday since it's release.
          And that ladies and gentelmen, is Map of The Soul. This album in my opinion is truly a piece of art *chef's kiss*. BTS has always given there best, bring out different ideas and concepts,different beats and styles.
          This album seems to have a very deep meaning, and also seems to be personal to the members as well. Each song has its own value in this album.
          Not only are the lyrics very deep, but the tracks on this album are well-produced and composed. 
          My top 3 favorite songs are Ugh, Black Swan, and Filter. I can listen to these songs on repeat and never get tired. This album also features solo songs from several members that also showcases their 
          individual artistry.  

          But with that be said, BTS is one of the hardest working groups I've ever witnessed. 
          They pour their "Blood, Sweat, and Tears" (thumbs up if you get the reference) into every piece of work.
          And If you haven't already, you should consider checking out their other albums too, because they have a lot of good songs.
